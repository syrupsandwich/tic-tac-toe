# tic-tac-toe
This is an assignment for [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-tic-tac-toe).

The main goal is to have as little global code as possible.

Play against 'dummy' or a local player.

If there is a draw, the player that started the last round will go second.

You can change the dimensions of the grid using the slider. 

A grid size larger than 3x3 will require a match of 4 in a row.

There will be an ai bot in a future update.
